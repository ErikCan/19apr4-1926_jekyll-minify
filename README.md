# [Fork] jekyll-compress-html (JCH) with additional `comments2` option


## This fork: Added `comments2` option

To strip off HTML *and* JS comments in one pass: original `comments: all` strips off `<!-- -->`, added `comments2: all` strips off `/* */`. As explained in the original [documentation][site] you might also set `comments` and `comments2` to two element arrays (start and end marker) of your choice.
